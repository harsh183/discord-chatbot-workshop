# Discord chatbot workshop

See the workshop it pairs with [here](https://125summer.netlify.app/chatbots) for 2021 UIUC CS 125 Summer of Side Projects.

## Setup

1. Install `python3` recent-ish along with `pip`

2. Install the depencencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Create a file called `BOT_TOKEN.txt` and paste in your discord bot's token. A good guide will be the start of [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/).

## Run

```bash
$ python bot.py
Token file read and bot started!
```
